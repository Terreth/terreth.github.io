<p>Evergreen provides a digital currency supported by real assets. It is an alternative to
existing currencies in that it is globally accessible, provides a stable store of value, and
supports the global ecosystem. It will be the default currency of the rapidly growing
collaborative consumption and crowd funding communities.</p>
